## Validator Testing
## HTML & CSS Validation

For validating the HTML and CSS in this project, I used **HTMLHint** to ensure the quality of the code.

During the validation process, the only errors detected were related to the usage of **Django template tags** (such as `{% extends %}`, `{% load %}`, and `{{ variable }}`) in the HTML files. These tags are required by Django for dynamic rendering of templates, and as such, they are not recognized by HTMLHint, which expects pure HTML syntax.

The specific errors, such as:
- **"Doctype must be declared first"**
- **"Special characters must be escaped"**

are a result of Django template syntax and do not affect the functioning of the project or its compliance with HTML standards.

### Tools Used:
- **HTMLHint** for validating HTML files.
- **Stylelint** for validating CSS (if applicable).

All static HTML and CSS passed validation successfully, with only template-related warnings being flagged.

Lighthouse showed low performance due to the ammount of large images used.

## Code Linting

During the development of the project, the code was checked for style and syntax issues using **Flake8**. Below are some of the common issues that were flagged and addressed:

### Issues Detected

./blog/migrations/0001_initial.py:20:80: E501 line too long (117 > 79 characters)
./blog/migrations/0001_initial.py:25:80: E501 line too long (101 > 79 characters)
./blog/migrations/0003_alter_comment_options_alter_post_options_like.py:27:80: E501 line too long (117 > 79 characters)
./blog/views.py:5:1: F401 '.models.Like' imported but unused
./blog/views.py:96:5: F841 local variable 'post' is assigned to but never used

### Fixes Applied

- **F401**: Unused imports were removed from the files.
- **F841**: Removed unused variables.
- **W293**: Removed unnecessary whitespace in blank lines.
- **E231**: Added missing whitespace after commas where necessary.

### Deployment Tools
- **Heroku**: The platform used to deploy the Eco-Nomad blog.
- **Git** & **GitHub**: Used for version control and collaborative development.

## Deployment
Hereâ€™s the deployment instructions with the code sections in plain text:

### **Deployment Instructions for Heroku**

#### **Pre-requisites:**
- Ensure you have a GitHub account and Heroku account.
- Install Git, Heroku CLI, and Python on your local machine.

#### **Deploying on Heroku**

1. **Clone the GitHub Repository:**
   - Open your terminal and clone the repository:

   `git clone <GitHub-repository-URL>`

   `cd <project-folder>`

2. **Set Up the Virtual Environment:**
   - Create and activate a virtual environment:

   `python3 -m venv venv`

   `source venv/bin/activate` (On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`)

3. **Install Requirements:**
   - Install the necessary packages from `requirements.txt`:

   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. **Create a New Heroku App:**
   - Log in to Heroku from the terminal:

   `heroku login`

   - Create a new Heroku app:

   `heroku create <your-app-name>`

5. **Prepare for Deployment:**
   - Ensure you have a `Procfile` that tells Heroku how to run your app.
   - Make sure your `runtime.txt` specifies the correct Python version.

6. **Add Heroku Remote:**
   - Add Heroku as a remote to your project:

   `heroku git:remote -a <your-app-name>`

7. **Set Up Environment Variables:**
   - Use the following command to add your environment variables (like `SECRET_KEY`, `DEBUG`, and database settings):

   `heroku config:set SECRET_KEY=<your-secret-key> DEBUG=False ALLOWED_HOSTS=<your-app-name>.herokuapp.com`

8. **Push the Code to Heroku:**
   - Commit any changes if necessary and deploy to Heroku:

   `git add .`

   `git commit -m "Initial Heroku deployment"`

   `git push heroku main`

9. **Apply Migrations:**
   - Once the app is deployed, apply the database migrations:

   `heroku run python manage.py migrate`

10. **Create a Superuser (Optional for Admin Access):**
    - Create a superuser to access the Django admin panel:

   `heroku run python manage.py createsuperuser`

11. **Open the App:**
    - After deployment, you can open your Heroku app in the browser:

   `heroku open`

#### **Forking the GitHub Repository**
If you wish to create a safe copy of the project to experiment with changes:

1. Log in to GitHub and navigate to the GitHub Repository.
2. Click the "Fork" button near the top of the page to create a copy of the repository.

#### **Making a Local Clone**
1. Under "Clone with HTTPS", click the clipboard icon to copy the link.
2. Open Git Bash and change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
3. Type `git clone`, add a space, and paste the URL that was copied earlier (in step 1). Press enter to create a clone.

## Testing:
The site was tested on various devices and browsers to ensure responsiveness and compatibility.
